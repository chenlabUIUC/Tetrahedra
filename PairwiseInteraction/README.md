# Pairwise interaction calculation for tetredron nanoparticles

This code is developed for conducting interaction calculation for tetrahedron nanoparticles. 
Date: 08/2022
Test: Matlab 2021b on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro using an Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-11400F CPU @ 2.60GHz processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 SUPER GPU. 
For more information about the project, algorithms, and related publications please refer to the Chen Group website.

# Getting started
1. Download the code (tetrahedra_pairwise_interaction.m) and pre-built tetrehra models in obj_to_coordinate folder.
2. Run the code following the comments. Parameters can be changed for difference purposes and different models.

# Notes
1. For running this code, GPU is required. 
2. To initialize the parameters or change the model, please follow the comments.
