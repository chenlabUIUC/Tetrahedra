# TetrahedraTracking

This code is developed for tracking tetrahedron position and lattice parameters in SEM images. One example SEM image and cropped areas with the tetrahedra contour is provided.
Data: 08/2022
This code is tested using Jupyter notebook
For more information about the project, algorithms, and related publications please refer to the Chen Group website.

# Getting started
1. Download the script (tetrahedr_tracking.ipynb) and the example data (SEM.tif as tracking image, Cropped_SEM.tif as the targeted particle, Tetrahedra_Contour.csv as the targeted particle contour).
2. Run the script in the jupyter notebook and modify the parameters following the comments.
3. Enjoy the tracking results!

# Notes
1. Don't forget to change the corresponding parameters to have the image properly tracked.
